# Configuration Files

- keybinds.h    : Contains every binding and custom user functions
- options.h     : Contains options to change fluorite behaviours
- design.h      : By default it just include a design files. I recommend that you create your theme file just like the other ones

Everything is commented and should be easy to understand and configure by yourself.
