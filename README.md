## Documentation ?

Go to [Fluorite Website](https://fluorite.surge.sh) for more informations. It should be mostly updated.

You can also find some quick tips inside [CONFIG.md](./CONFIG.md).

# Installation (basic informations)

## Deps

On Archlinux you can type this command to install everything you need.

``` sh
sudo pacman -S xorg xdotool libxft libxcomposite libxcursor libxrandr
```

## Build and install

After doing modifications to the config, just type this (WITHOUT sudo). It will remake and copy the Fluorite executable to `/usr/bin/`.

``` sh
make install
```

## .xinitrc example

``` sh
[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge -I$HOME ~/.Xresources # For autoloading your Xresources file
setxkbmap -layout fr
polybar &
picom &
exec Fluorite
```

Keep in mind that the setxkbmap with the proper keyboard layout is *REQUIRED* so you can have all your bindings working.

## Known issues

- If java apps are clunky, you can add `export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1` to your .xinitrc just before Fluorite execution.
